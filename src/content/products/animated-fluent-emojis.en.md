I had already found animated emojis in other projects, but the files were heavy,
the sets were incomplete or out of date, and their sites were painfully slow
when all I needed was one emoji. So I built it myself.

I started with the library and then used it for the gallery site. One import and
one tag work in React, Vue, Svelte, Astro or plain HTML, respect reduced motion
and hold their space while loading, so the page never shifts.

It is pre-1.0 and actively maintained.
