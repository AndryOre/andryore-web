# Architecture decision records

Decisions are recorded in
[Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):
`# NNNN: Title`, then `## Status` with a `Date: YYYY-MM-DD` line, `## Context`,
`## Decision` (with the options that were rejected) and `## Consequences`.
`adr-invariants.test.ts` enforces the header format, unique, ascending numbers,
an allowed status, and that this index lists every ADR.

To add one, copy the next number, write the file, and add a row below, filling
the last column when it amends or supersedes another. The rules for editing ADRs
are in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#architecture-decision-records).

| Number | Title                                                                                                    | Status   | Superseded or amended by        |
