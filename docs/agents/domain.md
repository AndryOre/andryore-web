# Domain docs

How domain-modeling-aware skills should consume this repo's domain
documentation, and how it relates to the rest of the `docs/` tree.

## Two different kinds of ground

The `docs/` tree is **published** ground: finished reference material, written
and maintained by hand. Don't restructure it or fold `CONTEXT.md` into it.

`CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` are the **live** ground that domain-modeling
maintains as `/forge` runs features through this repo: its ubiquitous language
and the architectural decisions made along the way. Add a term or a decision
only when it actually crystallizes in a session, never speculatively.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

## File structure

Single-context repo: one root `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/`.

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
└── docs/adr/
    ├── 0001-....md
    └── 0002-....md
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (an issue title, a ticket, a test name),
use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary
explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either
you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider), or there's a
real gap worth noting for `domain-modeling` to close.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than
silently overriding it — e.g. "Contradicts ADR-0003 (X), but worth reopening
because Y."
