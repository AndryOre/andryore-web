## About

andryore.dev is a static Astro site in English and Spanish where Andry writes
down what he builds, what worked and what did not. It holds a page for each
product and contribution, plus the tools and setup he uses day to day:

- **Snug**: a browser extension to export, import and back up bookmarks.
- **Animated Fluent Emojis**: Microsoft's animated Fluent emojis as one
  component.
- **JSON Flow**: a VS Code extension that turns JSON, YAML, XML and CSV into
  interactive graphs. A contribution: Andry built its marketing site and parts
  of the webview.
- **Uses**: the tools, tech and setup behind what he builds and streams.

## Quick start

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh) `1.4.2`; see
[prerequisites](docs/development.md#prerequisites).

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

Then run the checks before you push:

```sh
bun run check
bun run test
```

Details are in [Running locally](docs/development.md#running-locally) and the
[script reference](docs/development.md#scripts).
